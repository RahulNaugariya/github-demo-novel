- We meet Nick, Tim, Daisy, and
Jordan

The events of the novel happen in the summer of 1922. Nick Carraway, a man who grew up in the American Midwest, is the narrator. Nick is a World War I veteran and a Yale University graduate who wants a more exciting life. He moves to New York, to be a bonds salesman. There, he rents a house in the small community of West Egg. The person living next to him is Jay Catsby, a mysterious man who also has a lot of money. Jay Catsby also hosts many expensive parties frequently. Strangely, he never participates in his own parties; because of this, many rumors are formed as to Catsby's true identity and background. Nick drives out to visit his cousin Daisy in East Egg. There, he meets her husband, Tom Buchanan. He is also introduced to her friend, Jordan Baker. Nick learns from her that Tom has been having an affair with Myrtle Wilson. Nick decides to hold his judgment.
