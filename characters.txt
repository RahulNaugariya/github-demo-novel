James Gatz is seventeen years old, loafing along the shores of Lake Superior when he sees a yacht under the threat of being broken up on the shoals of Little Girl Bay. James borrows a rowboat and rows out to warn the sailor. That sailor is millionaire, Dan Cody who has made his money in silver and copper and when James Gatz introduces himself, Jay Catsby is born. When Dan Cody boards the TUOLEMEE for the Barbary Coast, Jay Catsby goes with him. He teaches Jay how to dress and behave like a gentleman for five years until he "inhospitably" dies. Cody's mistress then cheats Catsby out of a $25,000 bequest meant for him.

In 1917, during his training to join the infantry in preparation to for the Great War (World War I), 27-year-old Catsby falls in love with 18-year-old Daisy Fay, who is everything he's not: rich and from an elite, upper class Louisville, Kentucky family.
